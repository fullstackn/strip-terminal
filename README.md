  <h1>Strip Terminal Payments</h1>
</div>

Boilerplate for Stripe Terminal payments. 

App supposed to be called from menu of order details by calling option `Stripe Terminal Payment`.

The application page displays 
- information about the order we intend to pay for
- buttons for payment and refund

TODO
- Implement the correct payment creation process as described <a href="https://docs.saleor.io/developer/payments/payment-apps">here</a>
, so Stripe Terminal Payment should create payment and transaction linked with the order.
